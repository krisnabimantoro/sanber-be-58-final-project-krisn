### Final project NodeJS Bootcamp - Sanbercode
This API is designed for an <code>e-commerce platform</code>, built using <code>Express.js</code> and <code>Node.js</code>, with <code>MongoDB</code> as the database. It provides comprehensive functionality for managing categories and products, including full CRUD operations. Users can register, log in, and authenticate via JWT, allowing them to securely manage their sessions and edit their profiles. 

The platform enables customers to create orders, which are automatically linked to their user accounts via JWT payloads. Upon successful order creation, the system sends a confirmation email using <code>Nodemailer</code>, ensuring a seamless and integrated shopping experience.
